It allows for the making of robust and reuseable components that can be used anywhere in the application, even within another component. React is a step up from vanilla JavaScript because it moves away from the traditional DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation.
    \n
    Each react component is bound by state cycle management. In a functional component, these states are managed by react hooks. Hooks allow us to perform actions when the current state is changed such as a change in an input.`

    Some of the reasons I had chosen NodeJS for my service applications is because I liked the "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm. I would have the freedom to use JavaScript as my client side and service language.
